        Matt has a confession. For as long as he can remember, he's <strong>hated</strong> carbonation.
        Not disliked. <em>Hated.</em> The burning in his mouth. The involuntary burping.
        The way every sip feels like a tiny, fizzy assault on his dignity.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
        But Matt loves soda. The flavors, the sweetness, the refreshment &mdash; all of it.
        Just not the part where his drink attacks him.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
        So Matt developed a system. A ritual, really.

        He's done this at barbecues. At restaurants (the waiters have questions). In his car &mdash;
        which he does not recommend. He's ruined shirts. He's gotten stares. He once performed
        The Ritual on a first date.

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed italic">
        There was no second date.

        One night, standing in his kitchen, shaking a bottle of ginger ale for the fourth time, it hit him:

      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-coral pl-6 py-2">

        He looked at the now-flat ginger ale in his hand. It was perfect. It was exactly what he wanted.
        And nobody sold it. <strong>Until now.</strong>
