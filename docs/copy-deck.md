## The Problem Section

### Headline
"Your drink shouldn't hurt."

### Body Copy (Draft)
Let's be honest. Carbonation is a bully.

It burns your throat. Assaults your taste buds. Makes you burp at the worst possible moments. And for what? Some bubbles? The flavor was fine without them.

For over a century, the soda industry has been adding aggressive carbonation to drinks and nobody stopped to ask: "Does anyone actually *like* this part?"

We did. The answer was no.

### Comparison Copy
**Regular Soda:** Burns. Fizzes. Explodes when shaken. Will fight you.
**Matt's Flat:** Smooth. Flavorful. Shake it all you want. It's chill.

## The Story Section (Matt's Origin)

### Headline
"The Man Who Shook the Bottle"
or
"How One Man's War on Bubbles Started a Revolution"

### Full Story (Draft)

Matt has a confession.

For as long as he can remember, he's hated carbonation. Not disliked. *Hated.* The burning in his mouth. The involuntary burping. The way every sip feels like a tiny, fizzy assault on his dignity.

But Matt loves soda. The flavors, the sweetness, the refreshment — all of it. Just not the part where his drink attacks him.

So Matt developed a system. A ritual, really.

**Step 1:** Open the bottle carefully.
**Step 2:** Pour some out to create headroom.
**Step 3:** Reseal. Shake vigorously.
**Step 4:** Slowly crack the cap to release the gas.
**Step 5:** Repeat steps 2-4 until the drink surrenders.

He's done this at barbecues. At restaurants (the waiters have questions). In his car — which he does not recommend. He's ruined shirts. He's gotten stares. He once performed The Ritual on a first date. She watched in silence as he shook, released, shook, released, and finally took a satisfied sip of his now-perfectly-flat Coke.

There was no second date.

One night, standing in his kitchen, shaking a bottle of ginger ale for the fourth time, it hit him:

*"Why am I the one doing all the work? Why doesn't someone just... make it this way?"*

He looked at the now-flat ginger ale in his hand. It was perfect. It was exactly what he wanted. And nobody sold it.

Until now.

**Matt's Flat.** Born from frustration. Perfected through years of unauthorized bottle-shaking. Made for everyone who secretly wished their soda would just calm down.

## How It Works Section

### Headline
"What does 'flat' actually mean?"
or
"Flat ≠ Broken"

### Body Copy (Draft)
Matt's Flat has just enough carbonation to know it's there — a gentle, barely-there effervescence that lets the flavor do the talking.

We're not talking about leaving a bottle open on the counter for three days (though Matt has done that too). We're talking about a precisely crafted level of carbonation that's:

- **Gentle** enough that it won't burn your throat
- **Smooth** enough to actually taste what you're drinking
- **Present** enough that it still feels like a soft drink
- **Calm** enough that you can shake the bottle without consequences

It's not still. It's not sparkling. It's *flat.* And it's the future.

- Sleek, modern aluminum can design
- Matte finish with pastel color per flavor
- Clean, rounded sans-serif typography for "Matt's Flat" logo

- Each can features its flavor pastel as the primary color
- Consistent logo placement and sizing across all flavors

- Need: individual cans, group shots, lifestyle contexts, hero compositions

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Do
- Be funny but not try-hard
- Use first person ("we" or "Matt") — never corporate third person
- Lean into puns and wordplay around "flat," "fizz," "bubbles," "still," "calm"
- Keep copy short and punchy — every word earns its place
- Be self-aware — we know this concept is a bit ridiculous, and that's the point
- Make the reader smile

### Don't
- Be mean or negative about other brands (playful jabs are OK, punching down is not)
- Reference specific competitor brand names (trademark risk)
- Use corporate buzzwords ("synergy," "innovative," "disrupt")
- Over-explain the joke
- Be preachy about health benefits — this isn't a health brand, it's a fun brand
- Use aggressive sales language — the brand sells itself through charm
