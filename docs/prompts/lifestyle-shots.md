## Notes

1. All lifestyle shots should feel **warm, casual, and fun** — never sterile or corporate
2. The cans should always be the **matte pastel finish** — never glossy
3. Lighting should be **warm and natural** — golden hour preferred
4. People in shots should look **relaxed and happy** — never posed or stiff
5. Include the **"Matt's Flat" branding** visible on the can in every shot
6. The liquid being poured should always look **calm and smooth** — minimal bubbles
