## Notes for Consistency

1. **Generate one can first** (The Original Flat) and use it as a style reference for all others
2. **Same can shape** across all renders — don't let the AI change proportions
3. **Same logo placement** — "Matt's Flat" always centered, flavor name always below
4. **Same lighting setup** — soft, warm, studio quality
5. **Test with Midjourney v6+** or **DALL-E 3** for best results
6. **Use --style raw** in Midjourney for more photorealistic results
7. **Seed lock** in Midjourney: once you get a can shape you like, use --seed [number] for consistency
